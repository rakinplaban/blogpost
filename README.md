## Run the flask project in environment variable:
`set FLASK_APP=filename.py` <br>
`set FLASK_DEBUG=1` **turn on debug mode** <br>
`run filename.py`<br>


## Run code without setting up environment variables:
`python filename.py`<br>
**Note:** for this I have to turn my debug mode on in execution time.
